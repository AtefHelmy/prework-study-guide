<!-- 
Make note of the necessary declarations at the top of this code, including:
  Code type declaration <!DOCTYPE html>
  The entirety of the code then goes inside the html element like so 
    <html lang="en"> 
      Code
    </html>
  The code requires both <head></head> and <body></body> elements
The head element contains metadata for the webpage
The body element contains the actual webpage data that will be seen
The title element is necessary for webpage and vital for search engine
optimization
The style element defines the CSS styles used in the website
The base element defines the base URL for the webpage
The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document
The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document
The meta element is within the head element and
defines the metadata for the webpage. Make sure to visit the link on
3.1.3. to review the types of information that can be stored in the
meta element. Examples of metadata found in that link can be found in
the head of this example code
Review what is UTF-8 and character encoding

The arrows on the right allow us to open and close certain elements to
open and close certain chunks of code so make the code more organizable
and workable
