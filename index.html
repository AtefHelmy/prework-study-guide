        <ul>

          <li>The head section contains metadata, refer to this
            file for common declarations
          </li>
          <li>The body element contains the webpage data the 
            user sees
          </li>
          <li>
            The entire code goes inside of an html element, 
            where you also define the language &lt;html lang="en"&gt;


          </li>
          <li>The title element goes in the head, 
            and is critical for the page</li>
            <li>The base element defines the base URL for the page
              and it must be in the head
            </li>
            <li>The link element connets an external resource to
              the HTML document
            </li>
            <li>The script element embeds client-side 
              scripts in the HTML document</li>
        </ul>


      </section>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        
        <ul>

          <li>The style element is the way that you add css
            styling to your html elements
          </li>
          <li>You can style the entire document with *</li>
          <li>You can style an element, all of an element tag
            with element {style-attribute: value;}
          </li>
          <li> you can create and define classes inside html elements
            and then style these elements with .classname {}
          </li>
          <li> I tried messing around and centering the unordered list,
            but ended up having trouble, it would center the text, but not
            bullet points. To solve this, you have to change the value
            of list-style-position to inside, default it is outside. 
          </li>
          <li> I had trouble changing the space between text and bullet
            points. One outside solution was to put the actual text inside
            li element within a span element. Now within the span element,
            can make the position of the text, not the line of the bullet point,
            but just the text itself position relative and move it to the left
            and right. Example of how to do so is commented at the bottom of
            the html code for this page. 
            <li>
              Every element follows the box model. There is internal padding,
              a border, and external margins, which along with the actual size
              of the element, determine the overall width and length of the element
            </li>
          </li>
          <li> We used border to create a border, and input a thickness
            in pixels, and a color. We used box-shadow to create the box-shadow
            effect. It can have up to 4 inputs, which are x displacement,
            y displacement, shadow blurring, and shadow spreading.
          </li>
          <li> I thought the top and bottom of the border was too close to
            the text in the border, so I added padding to the top and bottom
            of the entire card. In addition, I thought the bottom of title of 
            each card was too close to the first bullet point. I could have
            done this either via heading or list, but I added a top-margin to
            lists inside each card. 

          </li>

        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">

        <h2>GIT</h2>
        
        <ul>

          <li>To make edits, create branch, make local edits, add changes to git commit
            , then commit those changes to the working local git version, then push
            those changes to the github repository.
          </li>

          
          
          <li> Everytime we start a coding session, we first want to
            start the ssh agent, which is accomplished by first starting
            the agent with eval "$(ssh-agent-s)", and then adding our
            computer SSH key with ssh-add
          </li>
          <li>git init to initialize a local repository</li>
          <li>git status to check which branch, and see changes to
            be commited</li>
            <li>git add to add a change to the changes to be committed</li>
            <li>git commit to commit to the local working 
              git repository branch</li>
              <li>git push origin branchname to push to online github</li>
              <li>git pull origin branchname to pull copy from github,
                which is good to do at the start of your coding sessions
                if there are others working on a branch with you
              </li>
              <li>Probably the easiest and best way to make local and online
                respositories sync is to first make one online via Github, and
                then to clone that repository using git clone URL/SSH
              </li>
              <li>git checkout to change branches, -b to make a new branch</li>
              <li>git add -A to add ALL changes that can be committed</li>

  The code requires both <head></head> and <body></body> elements
The head element contains metadata for the webpage

optimization
The style element defines the CSS styles used in the website
The base element defines the base URL for the webpage
The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document
The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document
The meta element is within the head element and
defines the metadata for the webpage. Make sure to visit the link on
3.1.3. to review the types of information that can be stored in the
meta element. Examples of metadata found in that link can be found in
the head of this example code
