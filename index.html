        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>The head section contains metadata, refer to this
            file for common declarations
          </li>
          <li>The body element contains the webpage data the 
            user sees
          </li>
          <li>
            The entire code goes inside of an html element, 
            where you also define the language &lt;html lang="en"&gt;


          </li>
          <li>The title element goes in the head, 
            and is critical for the page</li>
            <li>The base element defines the base URL for the page
              and it must be in the head
            </li>
            <li>The link element connets an external resource to
              the HTML document
            </li>
            <li>The script element embeds client-side 
              scripts in the HTML document</li>
             <li>
              The alt tag for image is what text will show if the image does not show. Also for text to speech and for accessibility. Its good to be descriptive as possible with this tag
             </li> 
              <li>
                Div can also be used for a single element                
              </li>
              <li> An element can have multiple classes: <br><br>&#60;element class="class1 class2 class3"&#62; &#60;/element&#62; note that the classes are not separate quotes, and there is only one class declaration

              </li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        
        <ul>

          <li>The style element is the way that you add css
            styling to your html elements
          </li>
          <li>You can style the entire document with *</li>
          <li>You can style an element, all of an element tag
            with element {style-attribute: value;}
          </li>
          <li> You can create and define classes inside html elements
            and then style these elements with .classname {}
          </li>
          <li> I tried messing around and centering the unordered list,
            but ended up having trouble, it would center the text, but not bullet points. To solve this, you have to change the value of list-style-position to inside, default it is outside. 
          </li>
          <li> I had trouble changing the space between text and bullet
            points. One outside solution was to put the actual text inside li element within a span element. Now within the span element, can make the position of the text, not the line of the bullet point, but just the text itself position relative and move it to the left and right. Example of how to do so is commented at the bottom of the html code for this page. 
            <li>
              Every element follows the box model. There is internal padding, a border, and external margins, which along with the actual size of the element, determine the overall width and length of the element
            </li>
          </li>
          <li> We used border to create a border, and input a thickness
            in pixels, and a color. We used box-shadow to create the box-shadow effect. It can have up to 4 inputs, which are x displacement, y displacement, shadow blurring, and shadow spreading.
          </li>
          <li> I thought the top and bottom of the border was too close to the text in the border, so I added padding to the top and bottom of the entire card. In addition, I thought the bottom of title of each card was too close to the first bullet point. I could have done this either via heading or list, but I added a top-margin to lists inside each card. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The font-family property specifies the font, separated by commas, ina  list. The reason you should do this and not a single font is beacuse the first font is the default, but if the browser cannot display that font it will try the next font and so on. Any fonts with a space need to be in quotes. Can review the instructor file in _11.
          </li>
          <li>
            The display proper displays the display behavior. Usually takes default value, which is inline. This is a very valuable attribute to look into
          </li>
          <li>
            Inline do not start on a new line, and only take up as much width as necessary.
          </li>
          <li>
            Block elements take up the entire line and take up the full width available. Some examples are P and Lists. These elements can be inside another element and take up only that width and therefore note take up the entire page.             
          </li>

        <h2>GIT</h2>
        
        <ul>

          <li>To make edits, create branch, make local edits, add changes to git commit, then commit those changes to the working local git version, then push those changes to the github repository.
          </li>
          <li> Everytime we start a coding session, we first want to
            start the ssh agent, which is accomplished by first starting
            the agent with eval "$(ssh-agent-s)", and then adding our
            computer SSH key with ssh-add
          </li>
          <li>git init to initialize a local repository</li>
          <li>git status to check which branch, and see changes to
            be commited</li>
            <li>git add to add a change to the changes to be committed</li>
            <li>git commit to commit to the local working 
              git repository branch</li>
              <li>git push origin branchname to push to online github</li>
              <li>git pull origin branchname to pull copy from github,
                which is good to do at the start of your coding sessions
                if there are others working on a branch with you
              </li>
              <li>Probably the easiest and best way to make local and online respositories sync is to first make one online via Github, and then to clone that repository using git clone URL/SSH
              </li>
              <li>git checkout to change branches, -b to make a new branch</li>
              <li>git add -A to add ALL changes that can be committed</li>
              <li>To find the README template I can use for future projects, there is one saved in local bootcamp_notes folder. 
              </li>The font-family property specifies the font, separated by commas, in a list. The reason you should do this and not a single font is beacuse the first font is the default, but if the browser cannot display that font it will try the next font and so on. Any fonts with a space need to be in quotes. Can review the instructor file in _11
            <li> While in github, use ctrl K to open a useful accessibility menu

        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        
        <ul>

          <li>In javascript, you have some topics similar to the very basics of java, such as declaring variables,
            declaring functions, calling functions to be used to actually execute them, if then statements, for loops,
            and a library of built in functions
          </li>
          <li>To use javascript, you must link the HTML file to the javascript file. This is 
            placed in the <span>&#60;BODY&#62;</span> </li>
          <br>
          <li>var randomTopic = topics[Math.floor(Math.random() *topics.length)]; <br><br>The above function to pick a 
            random topic functions as follows. The elements in the array range from 0-3, so this must be a function that 
          randomizes selecting one of the four possibilities. Math floor is a function I remember that returns the largest
          integer less than it's input. So floor 2=2, floor 3.99 = 3. topics.length must do what its name says, return the 
          length of the topics array, which is 4. In order to generate any number between 0-4, that means math.random 
          generates a decimal value between 0 and 1. I was worried about the case where the result is 1, and therefore
          1*4=4, which is not one of the cases. Google states that the math random returns a value bigger than 0 and
          less than 1, non-inclusive.
          </li>
        </ul>
